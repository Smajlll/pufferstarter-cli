# Getting your OAuth2 Credentials
First log into your PufferPanel, using your email and password and head to the "Account" section:
![img.png](../imgs/img11.png)
Down in the "OAuth2 Clients" section, click on "Create"
![img_1.png](../imgs/img_1.png)
Write the name, and some description about that client.
![img_2.png](../imgs/img_2.png)
Then click Create.

A window like this will pop up, write down your Client ID and Client Secret, then press the X in the right hand corner.

You now created your own OAuth2 Credentials for use with PufferStarter!

### Where to continue?
Try [Configuring](configuration-file.md) PufferStarter, so you don't have to enter your credentials every time you start it!
