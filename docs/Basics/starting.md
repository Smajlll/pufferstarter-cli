# Starting PufferStarter
There are multiple ways to start PufferStarter, this guide works with the idea, that you already build/installed, if you do not, check the [Installation Instructions](../Basics/Installation.md), or [Building Instructions](../Building/binst.md).

1) Starting PufferStarter Interactively 

Starting PufferStarter interactively is recommended if you are using PufferStarter for the first time. Check out all the functions in the [Feature Tour](../Basics/featuretournoint.md)

To start PufferStarter interactively, use `pufferstarter-cli -i`
2) Starting PufferStarter non-interactively

This isn't recommended if you aren't familiar with the PufferStarter syntax. You also need to create a Config File to use PufferStarter non-interactively, see [the config documentation](../Configuration/configuration-file.md).

To start PufferStarter non-interactively, use `pufferstarter-cli <args>`

?> You can see all of the arguments in the [documentation](../Usage/noninteractive.md)
