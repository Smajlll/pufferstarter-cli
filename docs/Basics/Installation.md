# Installation
This document will guide you through installing PufferStarter, so you could use it to its full potential.

### Dependencies
For PufferStarter to work property, you need these two things:
- cURL installed (For Windows, the bundled version is enough)
- A PufferPanel instance hosted somewhere, you also need to know its IP Address

### Installation
To install PufferStarter, you need to go to [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Smajlll/pufferstarter-cli/releases/), and download the following files for your OS:
- `pufferstarter_cli.exe` for Windows
- `pufferstarter_cli.tar.gz` for Linux and other UNIX systems

After you download those files, continue with these instructions for you OS of choice:
#### For Windows:
- You are all set, just start the file and you are good to go!
#### For Linux and other UNIX systems:
- Untar the file using `xd nevim`
- Run this command `chmod +x ./pufferpanel_cli` so you can execute it
- Start the `pufferpanel_cli` file you extracted, and you are all set!

### And what next?
You can start using the program right away. But I recommend you look into the [Config file](../Configuration/configuration-file.md), so you can make your user experience better.
